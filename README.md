# episode_manager
A wrapper for configuring and setting up training episodes with carla scenario runner for simpler integration with Gym environments for reinforcement learning

Used as part of the tools when working on my master's thesis for 
self-driving cars in simulated environments.

## If there is any demand for trying to use this code

Contact me at haavard.stavnas.markhus@gmail.com if
you have any demand for using this package for e.g. your 
NTNU thesis.
I will (if there is any deand)
at some point document usage of this and/or spend some time 
simplifying setup and dependencies for this.

Otherwise, this will stay as is.
